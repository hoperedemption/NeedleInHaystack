We have not done very sophisticated unit tests, only those that confirm correct behaviour.
You can find most of them in the tests folder in done.
Other tests we made were end to end tests done directly on the terminal or on the browser. 
For example, we have launched 5 clients simultaneously with the curl and the '&' command in linux on the terminal.
Another example: we have tested correctness of behaviour by launching multiple tabs in our browser with the server running on the terminal.
We tried delete/insert/read/list commands and the behaviour was consistent with the one explained in the handouts.
We also tried inserting new .jpg images downloaded from the internet. All works fine on our end.

The code went through intensive debugging with gdb and a lot of proofreading.
You can see from the time.csv that we spent a lot of time before the deadlines, going through
all details. So we hope the code is mostly bug free.
